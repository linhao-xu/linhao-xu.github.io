I am currently a fifth-year ph.D student from the Department of Biology at University of Miami, advised by Professor Don DeAngelis. I am now studying theoretical ecology, including ecological modelling, long transients, spatial patterns, aquatic invasive species, biocontrol, spatial heterogeneity, and stability.
